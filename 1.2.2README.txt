Version 1.2.2 

Added onsubmit="return validateNameAndPrice()" to validate that:
   a NAME is entered
   that the order has been confirmed and PRICE totalled
   and that the price is greater than zero (something is ordered)

Figured out how to use SELECT OPTION for quantity
and how to omit an entry from the FORM data when quantity = 0

Discovered "?subject=Diorios Online Order" to add subject line to email.

Discovered enctype="text/plain" which makes email body much more readable.
Example:

pizza=cheese_slice
top=pepperoni
top=peppers
sub1=turkey_full
name=Kirby Gamble
price=$13.00

Further work required:

1. implement SELECT OPTION for most items
2. implement multiple pizza/calzone orders
