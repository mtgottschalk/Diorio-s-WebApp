Version 1.3.1 

Added SELECT OPTION for pulldown quantity to everything except PIZZA & CALZONE, which still need further work because of the filling selectability.

Added buttons with image backgrounds to turn on/turn off the display of a section of menu.
The pizza, stromboli, sausage rolls, calzone, salads, and subs sections can now be 
individually selected to be displayed in any combination.

Fixed the bug that required two mouse clicks for the first display button press.  This
was done by initializing the style.display to 'none'.

Did away with the "Confirm Order and Show Price" button and instead, the price is now automatically updated anytime a change is made to a SELECT/OPTION pull down quantity.



Further work required:
 
1. implement multiple pizza/calzone orders with different filling combinations.
2. implement a text box showing the customer's order so far (a shopping cart).
