Version 1.3.9 

Changed all SELECT OPTION buttons to INPUT TYPE="NUMBER" buttons.

Used CSS styling on the INPUT TYPE="NUMBER" buttons to color the up and down arrows and make them larger.

Implemented multiple pizza ordering with different filling combinations.

Implemented an "internal" database to make editing of pricing centralized.  The "internal" database is simply a javascript array embedded in the code, not anything like SQL.

The DIOROS.HTML file is still a "single-file solution". It's straightforward and gets the job done without the use of PHP or SQL.
